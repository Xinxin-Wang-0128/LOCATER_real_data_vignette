This folder contains example scripts for putative loci investigation.

3. putative investigation
To start, you will need to start from submit.sh.

In submit.sh, we generate a job file, then submit jobs in this job file in a job array. 
each line of the job file refers to a job, which in our case will use to our screening R script and a executable file.
(submit.sh -> run_jobs in 3-putative-investigation folder -> R script for screening in 3-putative-investigation folder)
